# 🧨 Project Vulcan

**Project Vulcan** is Florida Tech’s 2024–2025 aerospace capstone project, led by the **Florida Tech Rocketry Club**. Our mission is to design, fabricate, and test a **metal 3D-printed clustered chamber aerospike engine** with a **liquid-injected thrust vector control (LITVC) system**, capable of delivering **1.5 kN** of thrust.

The project aims to demonstrate advanced propulsion principles in a manufacturable, testable configuration — serving as a feasibility study for potential integration with **Vaya Space’s Dauntless first stage**.

🛠️ *This README is a living document — more technical detail and subsystem breakdowns coming soon.*

## 🧭 Overview

- 🔩 **Architecture**: Toroidal aerospike nozzle + liquid-injected TVC (LITVC)  
- 🚀 **Propulsion**: Solid rocket motors as thrust sources for cold-flow and static fire tests  
- 🖨️ **Fabrication**: Metal 3D printing with AlSi10Mg via MIMO Technick  
- 🏗️ **Test Hardware**: Fully custom 6-DOF test stand + altitude-simulating shroud  
- 🤝 **Mentorship**: In collaboration with **Vaya Space** and industry mentor **Kineo Wallace**

## 🛠️ Project Management Approach

- Agile methodology using **Jira** (epics, user stories, sprint planning)  
- Timeline tracking via **Gantt charts** and **burndown models**  
- Subsystems coordinated through structured epics (fabrication, testing, integration)  
- Applied **Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (LSS GB)** principles to streamline workflows, reduce project waste, and prioritize process efficiency across technical and documentation pipelines  
- Subteams include propulsion, mechanical, simulation, testing, and controls

## 🎓 Educational Context

Project Vulcan is not just a senior design project — it’s an interdisciplinary, industry-facing testbed that simulates real-world constraints in **propulsion**, **manufacturing**, and **systems integration**.

It builds on the lessons of our previous projects (ion engine, turbojet engine, precision machining) while challenging us to balance:
- Engineering ambition  
- Timeline discipline  
- Manufacturing realism

All under the constraints of a student-led, sponsor-reviewed capstone timeline.
