# 🔥 Compact Turbojet Engine

This project is a hands-on attempt to design, fabricate, and test a compact, fully functional **turbojet engine**. It is being developed under the **Florida Tech Rocketry Club** as a continuation of a concept first explored in **2022–2023**. The revived effort focuses on optimizing the original design with improved modeling, manufacturability, and practical testing pathways.

The system integrates thermodynamic principles, combustion, and rotor dynamics — all translated into real hardware using accessible tools like waterjet cutting, manual machining, and CAD.

## ⚙️ Current Status

- ✅ CAD modeling completed for all primary engine components  
- ✅ Compressor and combustor section schematics finalized  
- 💧 **Turbine blades will be waterjet cut** from **aluminum sheet stock**  
- 🧱 Currently **scaling up materials and component specs** to transition from prototype to more durable, test-ready hardware  
- 🧩 Once materials are fabricated, the team will proceed directly to **final assembly and integrated testing**

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a miniaturized turbojet with working compressor, combustor, and turbine stages  
- Prioritize **student-accessible fabrication methods** (manual machines, waterjetting)  
- Validate key physical behaviors (e.g., airflow compression, thermal limits, combustion performance)  
- Enable Rocketry Club members to gain exposure to **rotating machinery** and **aerospace propulsion systems**
