# ⚡ Ion Engine Project

This project is an experimental attempt at building a 3D printed ion propulsion system, inspired by electrostatic thruster concepts. Originally completed in 2023, we are now **revisiting and refining the design as part of the Florida Tech Rocketry Club**, collaborating with **Dr. Kirk** to investigate performance and improve reliability.

This engine is intended as a hands-on exploration of electric propulsion principles — including ion acceleration, charge separation, and grid design — and its construction makes extensive use of **additive manufacturing** and **high-voltage components**.

🛠️ *Writeup in progress — check back for detailed build logs, testing updates, and photos!*

## 📡 Current Status

- ✅ Initial assembly completed
- ✅ Test runs conducted with power supply connected
- ⚠️ One of the **anode/cathode grids** is currently **non-functional**
- 🔧 Diagnostic testing underway to isolate and correct the fault

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Understand and demonstrate the basic working principles of ion propulsion
- Optimize the grid configuration and power flow using feedback from Dr. Kirk
- Explore the role of material choice and print precision in electrostatic field behavior

## 🏷️ Context

This build is part of the **Florida Tech Rocketry Club's experimental propulsion division**, where we prototype unconventional concepts and revisit past builds to improve them with new tooling, faculty input, and lessons learned from other fabrication projects (like the ring, block, and tape dispenser).
